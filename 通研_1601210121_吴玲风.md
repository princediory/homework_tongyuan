Fundamental historical reasons which AI has flourished

In 1956, a group of far-sighted young scientists headed by McCarthy, Minsky, Rochester and Shennong were the first to propose a "artificial intelligence" in the study of a series of related questions about machine simulation intelligence Words, it marks the "artificial intelligence" this new discipline of the formal birth. So far, more than 50 years of development, artificial intelligence has become an extensive cross and cutting-edge science. However, after many years, artificial intelligence in recent years to heat. There is no doubt that in 2006 the emergence of the key technology of artificial intelligence - "deep learning" to make artificial intelligence with practical value, and depth of learning is cloud computing and large data on the background of the day to achieve substantial progress in 2006 So it is a turning point of artificial intelligence, because the amount of data is growing, more and more computing power, in the past is not practical to 2006 and gradually entered the practical stage.This means that in the road leading to artificial intelligence, two indispensable roles: large data, cloud computing, the three almost "iron triangle" relationship.

Large data in the history of the evolution of the machine played a pivotal role, whether it is voice, image recognition, semantic computing, all in the possession of large enough data on the basis of the Internet, mobile Internet data is artificial intelligence research In addition to the depth of learning neural network greatly improve the voice and picture system recognition rate, but at the same time support large data platform cloud computing also put forward higher requirements.

Artificial intelligence requires data support, and cloud computing provides a good data analysis tools and platforms, so the development of artificial intelligence is inseparable from the support of the two.

In fact, driven by artificial intelligence, the future of cloud computing is entering a new field of intelligent areas, which mainly show the three major trends.

First, large data surge, computing power into a new focus of cloud computing

The traditional era does not exist cloud computing argument, because the early need to solve the problem is the storage problem, tens of thousands of corporate Web sites need to network, and these companies only need to host services.

But the mobile era is a key turning point, with the arrival of the mobile era, the user left in the enterprise product data began to surge, compared to the PC era can be used to describe the astronomical figures, and electricity, logistics, Education, marketing, finance and many other industries are fully affected, these companies are increasingly need to pass the user's data, to their own product adjustments and improve planning, computing power has a great demand.

Cloud computing before the solution to the storage problem, but did not solve the problem of how to deal with large data. Therefore, how to efficiently deal with large data is the future of the new focus, when the storage capacity is no longer important, the computing power is becoming a new enterprise in the future pursuit of the object.

Second, the user interaction began to diversify, companies difficult to deal with it

The early PC era, subject to the inconvenient operation of the device, the user and the machine interact only through the text, but the mobile era of smart phones brought great portability, the user's request to start how far, picture request, voice Request, video request, and so many forms.

Enterprises only to seize these new forms of interaction, is to seize the future, so the need for artificial intelligence technology to respond to changes in user scenarios to help their users more convenient and efficient use of their products, regardless of the user's voice request or picture request Can be the correct response, but in fact the threshold of the entry threshold is extremely high, most companies can not set up a separate department to carry out research and development, so the third party to provide artificial intelligence services become the key.

Third, the rise of things, cloud computing to artificial intelligence comprehensive evolution

Following the German industry 4.0, China also made in 2014 China made 2025 plan, intelligent engineering has also been formally carried on the issue, in 2025 focus on manufacturing will be fully intelligent, to achieve a unified intelligent management.

Internet computing is different from other cloud computing, its focus is not on storage and hosting, which requires a standardized management rules, so that equipment can be unified access, unified scheduling, unified detection, etc., and all this again Relying on artificial intelligence technology, that is, in the Internet of things cloud computing, the traditional cloud computing has been unable to continue to do, not only need to combine with artificial intelligence, but also need to evolve into artificial intelligence.

The future is the era of data, users of the era of a variety of requests, Internet things Internet equipment, the traditional managed cloud computing will not be competent, and cloud computing will also be fully developed to artificial intelligence. Through the Internet of things generated, the collection of massive data stored in the cloud platform, and then through large data analysis, and even higher forms of artificial intelligence for human production activities, life needs to provide better service. In the future there is no cloud computing only artificial intelligence, and this trend has already begun.
